# P3-D rotated inline-edit manual smoke attempt

**Date:** 2026-08-29 14:32 Asia/Taipei  
**Branch:** `task13/p3d-interpretation-reuse`  
**Result:** BLOCKED -- not a passing manual smoke result.

## Required configuration

The requested launch configuration was prepared exactly as follows:

```powershell
$env:TEXT_COMMIT_ENGINE = "tiered"
$env:TEXT_COMMIT_PREVIEW = "plan"
$env:TEXT_COMMIT_MAX_TIER = "1"
& "<REPO>\.venv\Scripts\python.exe" main.py
```

For the interaction, a disposable one-page fixture was generated at
`tmp/pdfs/p3d-manual-rotated-smoke.pdf`. It contains `Price 2024`, uses a
standard Helvetica `Tj` show, and has `/Rotate 270`. An independent reopen
confirmed:

```text
pages=1 rotation=270 text='Price 2024\nTiered smoke fixture'
```

The fixture and non-sensitive launch capture remain in the ignored `tmp/pdfs/`
workspace for a resumed run; they are not shipped as repository artifacts.

## What blocked the interaction

The App launch attempted from this worktree did not create a new primary window:
the single-instance handoff targeted an already-running `\u8996\u89ba\u5316 PDF \u7de8\u8f2f\u5668` process instead. Before a file could be selected, the desktop entered the
Windows lock screen. This environment does not expose a permitted computer-use
control channel to unlock or impersonate the desktop user.

Consequently, none of the acceptance observations below were made, and this
record must not be interpreted as a smoke PASS:

- 5--10 plan-preview keystrokes (cold miss followed by warm cache hits);
- rotated preview orientation, clipping, or latest-generation behaviour;
- commit/preview visual parity;
- second edit after a page transition; or
- session/document-close lifecycle behaviour.

## Resume procedure

After the desktop is unlocked, first close the pre-existing PDF Editor instance
or launch the worktree App with its isolated single-instance endpoint. Then open
the prepared fixture, enter `\u7de8\u8f2f\u6587\u5b57`, edit `Price 2024` through several
delete/retype cycles, accept it, revisit the page, perform a second edit, and
close the session/document. Record each observation against the P3-D manual
checklist in the archived implementation plan.
