# P3-D rotated inline-edit manual smoke attempt

**Date:** 2026-08-29 14:32 Asia/Taipei  
**Branch:** `task13/p3d-interpretation-reuse`  
**Result:** FAILED -- the resumed interactive smoke reached the App pipeline
and found a rotated-page UI/plan-preview integration failure.

## Required configuration

The requested launch configuration was prepared exactly as follows:

```powershell
$env:TEXT_COMMIT_ENGINE = "tiered"
$env:TEXT_COMMIT_PREVIEW = "plan"
$env:TEXT_COMMIT_MAX_TIER = "1"
& "<REPO>\.venv\Scripts\python.exe" main.py
```

For the interaction, a disposable one-page fixture was generated at
`tmp/pdfs/p3d-manual-rotated-smoke.pdf`. It contains `Price 2024`, uses a
standard Helvetica `Tj` show, and has `/Rotate 270`. An independent reopen
confirmed:

```text
pages=1 rotation=270 text='Price 2024\nTiered smoke fixture'
```

The fixture and non-sensitive launch capture remain in the ignored `tmp/pdfs/`
workspace for a resumed run; they are not shipped as repository artifacts.

## Initial block

The App launch attempted from this worktree did not create a new primary window:
the single-instance handoff targeted an already-running `\u8996\u89ba\u5316 PDF \u7de8\u8f2f\u5668` process instead. Before a file could be selected, the desktop entered the
Windows lock screen. This environment does not expose a permitted computer-use
control channel to unlock or impersonate the desktop user.

Consequently, the first attempt made none of the acceptance observations below.
That initial result must not be interpreted as a smoke PASS:

- 5--10 plan-preview keystrokes (cold miss followed by warm cache hits);
- rotated preview orientation, clipping, or latest-generation behaviour;
- commit/preview visual parity;
- second edit after a page transition; or
- session/document-close lifecycle behaviour.

## Resumed interactive result

After the Windows desktop was unlocked, the pre-existing blank App instance was
closed and the worktree App was launched with the exact configuration above and
the rotated fixture. This was a real desktop interaction, not a QTest or model
test.

1. The fixture opened and visibly rendered `/Rotate 270` text vertically near
   the lower part of the page.
2. After selecting `Edit > Text edit`, the App drew two editable-region outlines
   horizontally near the top of the page instead of over the visible rotated
   text.
3. Clicking the actual visible `Price 2024` text did **not** open an inline
   editor. Clicking the incorrectly positioned outline did open an editor, but
   it opened at that incorrect top-of-page location. This breaks the basic
   rotated-text interaction before preview parity can be assessed.
4. Five edit-input events were attempted to exercise warm previews. The active
   Chinese IME initially composed non-ASCII input, so it cannot evidence the
   intended ASCII sequence; the final intended value was pasted and displayed
   as `Price 2025`. This does not change the observed geometry failure. The
   preview remained at the same wrong horizontal location while the PDF's
   original vertical `Price 2024` stayed visible below. No Stage-B cache result
   is claimed from this failed interaction.
5. Selecting Apply did not produce a plan-backed commit. The App displayed a
   confirmation dialog that reported `tier0:style_override_present -> legacy`.
   The fallback was explicitly declined, so the fixture was not silently
   committed through the legacy path.
6. The session/App then closed normally without a visible MuPDF exception or
   orphaned-object crash. A second edit cannot meaningfully validate cache reuse
   while the primary rotated hit region and plan path are broken.

Remote-review evidence (cropped to the App window only):

![Rotated text with wrong edit outlines](assets/p3d-smoke-text-mode-small.png)

![Preview at the incorrect top-of-page location](assets/p3d-smoke-pasted-small.png)

![Apply reports legacy fallback instead of plan commit](assets/p3d-smoke-after-apply-small.png)

The original full-screen captures remain ignored under `tmp/pdfs/`:

- `p3d-smoke-text-mode-small.png` -- visible vertical text and wrong top-page
  editable outlines;
- `p3d-smoke-overlay-click-small.png` -- editor opened at the wrong outline;
- `p3d-smoke-pasted-small.png` -- `Price 2025` preview at the wrong location;
- `p3d-smoke-after-apply-small.png` -- plan path declined in favour of the
  reported legacy fallback.

This is a reproducible **FAIL**, not an acceptance pass. The root symptom is
consistent with a visual/unrotated page-coordinate mismatch in the GUI text-hit
or editor-placement path; it is not attributed to `PageInterpretation` without
further diagnosis.

## Required retest

Fix and retest the visual-to-page mapping used by the text-edit hit region and
editor placement on `/Rotate 90` and `/Rotate 270`. Then repeat the same
multi-keystroke test and require an actual plan-backed commit (not the legacy
fallback) before marking P3-D's GUI smoke PASS.

## Retest after `32a7630`

The `/Rotate 270` placement change in `32a7630` was smoke-tested using the
same fixture and environment. The running App was confirmed to descend from the
worktree `.venv` launch, and the checked-out source contained the intended
`normalized_rotation == 270` `pos_y = y0 + scaled_rect.y0` code.

The interactive result remained **FAIL**:

1. Text-edit mode still drew horizontal editable-region outlines near the top
   of the page while the visible rotated text remained lower on the page.
2. Directly clicking the visible `Price 2024` still did not open an editor.
3. Clicking the misplaced outline opened the editor and rendered `Price 2025`
   at that same incorrect top-of-page location; the original rotated text
   remained below.
4. The temporary edit was cancelled and the App closed normally.

Therefore `32a7630` is insufficient to clear the manual smoke gate. The
remaining defect is upstream of, or independent from, the one `y0`/`y1` editor
placement branch: the text-edit selectable region and direct visual hit mapping
are still in a different coordinate space from the page raster.

## Diagnosis and fix (2026-08-29, after the revert `8eb91b5`)

Three independent, pre-existing defects (none introduced by P3-D; the GUI read
path had never converted page rotation):

1. **Coordinate-space class bug.** Every text-geometry value the model exposed
   to the View (`EditableSpan`/`TextBlock`/`EditableParagraph` bboxes,
   `TextHit.target_bbox`, glyph rects, selection bounds) was unrotated
   `get_text("dict")` space; the View is displayed (`page.rect`/`get_pixmap`)
   space; the controller forwarded verbatim. `TextHit.rotation` was the
   dict-space *text direction* (0 for this fixture), so the 270° editor branch
   that `32a7630` edited never executed. Probe on this fixture: index bbox of
   `Price` = (72, 101, 127, 125) (top-left, unrotated) vs raster ink
   (102, 426, 180, 539) (bottom-left, displayed); the hit-test accepted the
   dict centre and rejected the displayed centre.
2. **False style override.** `editing_font_name` held the raw span font
   (`"Helvetica"`) while `_editing_initial_font_name` held the UI alias
   (`"helv"`), so an untouched session sent `font_family="Helvetica"` and the
   plan path refused with `style_override_present`. Rotation-independent.
3. **Plan preview refused rotated editors** (`_install_plan_preview_hook`
   returned for `rotation != 0`), which would have silently disabled the exact
   preview on every `/Rotate 90/270` page once the hit rotation became the
   on-screen one.

Fix: the model's public text-geometry surface now speaks displayed space
(chokepoints in `model/geometry.py`; `PDFModel` wrappers convert in/out; the
index, resolve pipeline and engine stay unrotated; `edit_text` /
`derive_tier0_preview_target` derotate incoming rects; the legacy insert's
page-bounds clamps receive `unrotated_page_rect(page)`); the View compares the
session font against its baseline through one alias mapping (`_font_alias`),
the plan preview hook installs for every rotation, and `apply_plan_preview` /
`_capture_frozen_first_frame` counter-rotate the displayed-space raster into
the proxy frame through one shared table (90/180/270). An adversarial review
round on the diff surfaced three more defects (180° frozen frame grabbed the
margin; font pick-and-revert reported an override; legacy clamps against the
displayed `page.rect` broke htmlbox-path edits in the unrotated lower band of
quarter-turn pages), each fixed red-first.
Details: `plans/archive/task13-rotated-page-text-edit-geometry.md`.

Offscreen reproduction of this report, red before the fix and green after:
`test_scripts/test_text_edit_rotated_page_gui.py` (hover/outline on the ink,
click on the ink opens the editor with `_editing_rotation == rotation` and a
frozen first frame showing the glyphs on 90/180/270, no style override on an
untouched session or after a font pick-and-revert, plan-preview hook +
counter-rotation marker pixel per rotation, Apply commits at Tier 0 with no
fallback ask) and `test_scripts/test_text_geometry_page_rotation.py` (model
surface against a pixmap-ink oracle on `/Rotate 0/90/180/270`, plus the
legacy htmlbox path keeping its place near the unrotated bottom).

## Required retest (manual, unchanged)

Repeat the interactive procedure above on the same fixture with the same
launch configuration and require: outlines/hover on the vertical text, a
click on the vertical text opening a vertical editor over it, 5–10 plan
preview keystrokes (cold miss then warm hits), and a plan-backed Apply with
no legacy-fallback dialog.

## Manual retest after `f79c9d2` (2026-08-29)

The worktree at `f79c9d2` was launched with the required tiered/plan/Tier-1
environment and the same `/Rotate 270` fixture.  This was a real desktop
interaction.  The coordinate-space fix clears the original visual defect:

1. Text-edit mode drew the `Price 2024` selectable outline directly over the
   rendered vertical ink.
2. Clicking that visible text opened a vertical inline editor in the same
   location, with the expected 24pt Helvetica style.
3. Five successive replacement updates reached a correctly positioned,
   vertically oriented `Price 2025` preview; no rotation jump, clipping, or
   stale-frame overwrite was observed.

The plan-only commit gate did **not** pass in this manual run.  Applying the
clipboard-driven multi-update edit prompted `tier0:not_single_literal_i ->
legacy`; legacy fallback was explicitly declined.  A subsequent direct
single-character retry could not be evaluated because the active Chinese IME
inserted a composition character rather than literal ASCII.  The disposable
edit was cancelled and the App closed normally without a visible exception.

Result: **partial PASS for rotated hit-testing/editor placement/preview;
FAIL for the required plan-backed commit parity.**  This must not be promoted
to a complete P3-D manual-smoke PASS until a clean ASCII inline edit reaches
Tier 0 or Tier 1 and Apply completes without the legacy-fallback dialog.
