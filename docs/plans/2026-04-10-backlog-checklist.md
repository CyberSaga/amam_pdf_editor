# Backlog Closure Checklist

Purpose: keep a compact, current execution checklist alongside `TODOS.md` so backlog state survives conversation compaction and quick handoffs.

Last updated: 2026-04-13
Canonical tracker: `docs/plans/2026-04-09-backlog-execution-order.md`
Worktree: `<REPO>`

## Current State

- Current phase: Phase 7 (`B4`) final closure pass
- Current batch status: `B4` Slice 2 landed for open/page-change responsiveness; optimize-copy Slice 1 remains in place
- Resume from: compare the full B4 evidence set and decide whether B4 can move to done
- Next likely phase after B4 closure: review/approve one of the remaining child-plan items (`F1`, `F2`, `F3`, `F4`, or `UX7`)

## Completed In This Campaign

- [x] Normalize backlog tracking and establish canonical tracker
- [x] Replace root duplicate tracker with pointer file
- [x] `F5` Save As defaults to active document path/name
- [x] `UX1` Thumbnail column caps width and centers in wide sidebar
- [x] `B2` Single-line text edits keep anchor and avoid unnecessary neighbor push
- [x] `B3` Edit-mode outlines follow real selectable targets instead of coarse blank-area boxes
- [x] `UX3` Inline editor background is transparent and keeps real text color
- [x] `UX2` Rotated text editors now rotate with the underlying text
- [x] `UX6` Browse-mode text selection snaps partial drags to whole visual lines
- [x] Tighten run-anchored browse selection so block-whitespace near-misses no longer expand boundary lines to whole rows
- [x] `B1` Print jobs preserve printer defaults while keeping paper/orientation auto under app ownership
- [x] `UX4` Print auto-orientation follows each source page
- [x] `UX5` Print auto paper size follows each source page, while Linux/mac fixed-layout overrides fall back to raster
- [x] Fix Qt custom-page PDF output so landscape source pages stay landscape in generated PDF files
- [x] `F6` Thumbnail right-click page operations reuse the existing page helpers/signals
- [x] `F7` Browse-mode scene context menu now exposes richer page/file actions
- [x] `B4` Slice 1 adds preset-aware optimize-copy routing
- [x] `B4` Slice 2 defers background thumbnail/sidebar work until the initial page is ready and coalesces visible-render scheduling during open/page changes

## Deferred Follow-ups

- [ ] Revisit the real-mouse browse-selection boundary-line report after the performance work. Current code is committed, but the user still reports whole-line expansion during physical drags, so this needs a fresh manual verification pass later.

## Active / Next

- [ ] Run the final `B4` compare-and-close pass
- [ ] Review/approve child plans for `F1`, `F2`, `F3`, `F4`, and `UX7`

## Remaining Backlog

- [ ] `B4` Final evidence comparison and close decision
- [ ] `F1` Review/approve child plan for object manipulation
- [ ] `F2` Review/approve child plan for Surya OCR
- [ ] `F3` Review/approve child plan for shell/file-explorer integration
- [ ] `F4` Review/approve child plan for color profile switching
- [ ] `UX7` Review/approve child plan for macOS native menu bar

## Resume Notes

- Browse-mode selection is now run-anchored: start requires a direct run hit, end may snap to the nearest run, boundary lines are partial, and only fully covered middle lines expand to whole-line units. Do not regress this by falling back to raw clip-rect selection.
- Browse-mode hit-testing now has a strict path: selection start and end resolution must call `get_text_info_at_point(..., allow_fallback=False)` so block-whitespace misses do not silently degrade into line-start fallbacks.
- The committed browse-selection fix is deferred for follow-up, not the current critical path. Treat it as a checklist item to re-verify with a physical mouse after the performance tranche, unless the user reprioritizes it sooner.
- Print auto paper/orientation are now app-owned and source-following. Native printer properties still sync duplex/color/DPI/copies, but printer-default paper/orientation must not overwrite the dialog's `auto` state.
- Linux/mac direct-PDF printing is still allowed for source-following auto jobs. If the user explicitly fixes paper size or orientation in-app, the driver must force the raster path so per-page/source layout semantics are preserved.
- Qt custom page sizes must be created in portrait order before applying landscape orientation. Passing already-landscape dimensions into `QPageSize(..., Point, ...)` makes generated PDF output flip back to portrait.
- Thumbnail and scene context menus now share page-specific helper methods for delete/rotate/export/insert actions. Keep those helpers centralized in the view so the two right-click surfaces do not drift apart.
- `test_scripts/test_performance.py` now runs cleanly from the repo root without a manual `PYTHONPATH` override. Keep that script self-contained, because it is part of the `B4` baseline capture path.
- Current B4 baseline snapshot before the performance slices: startup/import+instantiate `PDFModel` ~0.444s; synthetic 300-page open ~20ms with first page render ~8ms; page renders on the same file were ~7.93ms (page 1), ~1.43ms (page 150), and ~1.13ms (page 300); repeated edit benchmark averaged ~34ms over 10 rounds; optimize-copy on `test_files/1.pdf` with the balanced preset took ~0.087s and saved ~21.8%; optimize-copy on `test_files/2024_ASHRAE_content.pdf` exceeded the initial 124s probe timeout.
- After `B4` Slice 1 on this machine: startup/import+instantiate `PDFModel` measured ~0.235s; synthetic 300-page open stayed healthy at ~18ms with first page render ~5ms; page renders on the same file measured ~4.6ms (page 1), ~0.67ms (page 150), and ~0.61ms (page 300); repeated edit benchmark averaged ~21ms over 10 rounds; optimize-copy on `test_files/1.pdf` with the balanced preset took ~0.037s and still saved ~21.8%; optimize-copy on `test_files/2024_ASHRAE_content.pdf` now measures ~15.6s for `快速`, ~20.4s for `平衡` with ~37.9% saved, and ~23.2s for `極致壓縮` with ~57.8% saved.
- After `B4` Slice 2 on this machine: `test_scripts/benchmark_ui_open_render.py` measures `test_files/1.pdf` at startup-to-placeholders ~391.7ms and initial high-quality page ready ~15.6ms; it measures `test_files/2024_ASHRAE_content.pdf` at startup-to-placeholders ~534.9ms, initial high-quality page ready ~78.1ms, and far-page jump to page 483 high-quality ready ~268.7ms. The startup controller tests now lock in “visible page first, background work later” plus visible-render coalescing.
- Keep `docs/plans/2026-04-09-backlog-execution-order.md` as the source of truth for statuses; update this checklist as the compact execution mirror.
