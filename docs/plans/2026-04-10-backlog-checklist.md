# Backlog Closure Checklist

Purpose: keep a compact, current execution checklist alongside `TODOS.md` so backlog state survives conversation compaction and quick handoffs.

Last updated: 2026-04-14
Canonical tracker: `docs/plans/2026-04-09-backlog-execution-order.md`
Worktree: `<REPO>`

## Current State

- Current phase: Phase 6 (`F1`) object manipulation v1
- Current batch status: F1 v1 object manipulation is now verified end-to-end for app-owned textboxes and app-created rectangle annotations
- Resume from: execute the v2 follow-up plan (`docs/plans/2026-04-14-f1-objects-mode-v2.md`)
- Next likely phase after F1: review/approve one of the remaining child-plan items (`F2`, `F3`, `F4`, or `UX7`)

## Completed In This Campaign

- [x] Normalize backlog tracking and establish canonical tracker
- [x] Replace root duplicate tracker with pointer file
- [x] `F5` Save As defaults to active document path/name
- [x] `UX1` Thumbnail column caps width and centers in wide sidebar
- [x] `B2` Single-line text edits keep anchor and avoid unnecessary neighbor push
- [x] `B3` Edit-mode outlines follow real selectable targets instead of coarse blank-area boxes
- [x] `UX3` Inline editor background is transparent and keeps real text color
- [x] `UX2` Rotated text editors now rotate with the underlying text
- [x] `UX6` Browse-mode text selection snaps partial drags to whole visual lines
- [x] Tighten run-anchored browse selection so block-whitespace near-misses no longer expand boundary lines to whole rows
- [x] `B1` Print jobs preserve printer defaults while keeping paper/orientation auto under app ownership
- [x] `UX4` Print auto-orientation follows each source page
- [x] `UX5` Print auto paper size follows each source page, while Linux/mac fixed-layout overrides fall back to raster
- [x] Fix Qt custom-page PDF output so landscape source pages stay landscape in generated PDF files
- [x] `F6` Thumbnail right-click page operations reuse the existing page helpers/signals
- [x] `F7` Browse-mode scene context menu now exposes richer page/file actions
- [x] `B4` Slice 1 adds preset-aware optimize-copy routing
- [x] `B4` Slice 2 defers background thumbnail/sidebar work until the initial page is ready and coalesces visible-render scheduling during open/page changes
- [x] Close `B4` with final before/after performance evidence

## Deferred Follow-ups

- [ ] Revisit the real-mouse browse-selection boundary-line report after the object-manipulation work.
- [ ] Resolve the low-level Windows injected-selection gap for object-verification automation. The temporary harness can create the mixed sample reliably, but object selection via injected clicks is still less trustworthy than the live `QTest` GUI pass.

## Active / Next

- [x] Finish the wider F1 verification pass
- [x] Run one successful mixed-sample GUI check that covers select, move, rotate, delete, undo, and redo for the supported object types
- [ ] Plan and implement `objects mode` (`操作物件`) so rectangles/images can be moved/rotated/deleted/resized and multi-selected without fighting browse/text-selection behavior (`docs/plans/2026-04-14-f1-objects-mode-v2.md`)
- [ ] Add resize handles and multi-select for textboxes inside text edit mode, alongside word editing
- [ ] Add app-inserted image objects (typed identity + move/rotate/delete/resize); defer native-PDF image manipulation until app-owned images are stable
- [ ] Review/approve child plans for `F2`, `F3`, `F4`, and `UX7`

## Remaining Backlog

- [x] `F1` Complete verification and close object manipulation v1
- [ ] `F1` Objects mode + resize + multi-select + images follow-ups (new child plan pending)
- [ ] `F2` Review/approve child plan for Surya OCR
- [ ] `F3` Review/approve child plan for shell/file-explorer integration
- [ ] `F4` Review/approve child plan for color profile switching
- [ ] `UX7` Review/approve child plan for macOS native menu bar

- [x] `python test_scripts/test_all_pdfs.py`
- [ ] Clear legacy `ruff` debt still reported in `view/pdf_view.py` and `controller/pdf_controller.py`

## Resume Notes

- `B4` is closed. Keep the benchmark scripts intact so future regressions are comparable to the captured before/after numbers.
- F1 v1 supports app-owned objects only: new textboxes plus rectangle annotations created by this app. No resize, no imported images, no legacy textbox migration.
- New textbox identity is persisted by a hidden companion annotation marker. Rectangle annotations carry app-owned metadata directly on the annotation.
- The broader GUI/manual path is now covered by a live `QTest` mixed-sample pass. The next F1 work is the v2 mode/resize/multi-select/image plan, not more v1 verification.
