  Code Review: F1 Native PDF Image Manipulation

  Overview

  This changeset adds support for selecting and manipulating native
  (pre-existing) PDF images in objects mode. It introduces a content-stream
  operator parser (model/pdf_content_ops.py), wires native image discovery into
  PDFModel, and extends move/resize/rotate/delete to rewrite cm operators
  instead of using redaction. Tests cover hit detection, topmost selection,
  move, resize, rotate, delete with shared resources, and delete with resource
  pruning. All 7 tests pass.

  ---
  Issues Found

  P0 — Correctness Bugs

  1. q_invocation_counts only tracks the innermost q scope
  (pdf_content_ops.py:189-190).
  If a q block contains a nested q..Do..Q and also a sibling Do, the outer q's
  count won't include the nested Do. When deciding whether it's safe to remove
  the whole q..Q block (q_image_invocation_count == 1), this can lead to
  accidentally deleting a sibling image invocation that lives inside a nested q
  within the same outer scope.

  1. Risk: Real-world PDFs often have q q cm /Im Do Q Q nesting. Deleting an
  image could silently remove a sibling.

  1. Fix: Bubble Do counts up to all ancestor q frames on the stack, not just
  stack[-1].
  2. occurrence_index assumes 1:1 correspondence with image_infos ordering
  (pdf_content_ops.py:225-227).
  The code increments occurrence_index for every image Do encountered and
  indexes into image_infos (from get_image_info(xrefs=True)). If a page has
  non-image XObjects that produce Do operators filtered out, or if
  get_image_info returns entries in a different order than content-stream
  encounter order, the index will be misaligned. The break on line 225 silently
  drops remaining images if counts diverge.

  2. Risk: Mis-association of bbox with the wrong image, or partial discovery on
   pages with form XObjects.
  3. _rotation_from_cm normalization divides by different scales for rows
  (pdf_content_ops.py:154-156).
  It normalizes (a, b) by max(|a|, |b|) and (c, d) by max(|c|, |d|). For a
  non-uniform scale (e.g., wide but short image), this produces correct unit
  vectors per row. However, for a shear matrix (non-axis-aligned), the
  best-match rotation could be wrong. This is acceptable given the documented
  constraint of quantized rotation, but worth noting that sheared images will 
  snap to the nearest 90-degree rotation and lose their shear on any 
  manipulation.

  P1 — Edge Cases / Robustness

  4. No cm operator → cm_operator_index is None → move/resize silently fails
  (pdf_model.py:1653-1654).
  _rewrite_native_image_matrix returns False when cm_operator_index is None.
  Some PDF generators emit images without an explicit cm (relying on the default
   identity CTM). The image would be selectable but unmovable/unrotatable with
  no user feedback.

  4. Suggestion: Insert a new cm operator before the Do when none exists, or
  surface the failure to the UI.
  5. last_cm_by_depth captures the last cm in the current scope, not necessarily
   the one belonging to the image (pdf_content_ops.py:217-218).
  If a graphics scope has cm cm /Im Do, the second cm wins. This is correct for
  the image, but if a scope has cm re f cm /Im Do (a rectangle draw followed by
  an image), the image's cm is correctly captured. However, if it's cm /Im1 Do 
  cm /Im2 Do, only Im2's cm is correct — Im1 would get Im1's cm (the one set
  before the first Do), which is correct. So this appears fine for the common
  patterns. Just flagging that it's a "last seen" heuristic, not a definitive
  association.
  6. serialize_tokens joins with \n between every token
  (pdf_content_ops.py:268-270).
  The original stream uses mixed whitespace (spaces between operands, newlines
  between operators). Newline-per-token is technically valid PDF but bloats the 
  stream (~2x for long pages) and could trigger rendering differences in picky
  viewers. It also makes the content stream harder to read for debugging.

  6. Suggestion: Join operands within an operator with spaces, operators with
  newlines.
  7. fitz_rect_to_stream_cm does a Y-axis flip (pdf_content_ops.py:281-283)
  using page_height - y1 for the e,f translation. This assumes the page's
  coordinate system has origin at bottom-left (standard PDF). If the page has a
  non-default /MediaBox origin or a page-level /Rotate, the Y calculation could
  be wrong.

  7. Risk: Low for typical documents; could misplace images on rotated pages.

  P2 — Code Quality

  8. Ruff violations in new code — pdf_model.py:2213 has an unused variable xref
   (pre-existing but in the diff context). The test file has E402 import-order
  violations (acceptable for test files with sys.path manipulation, but worth
  suppressing with # noqa).
  9. _make_shared_native_image_pdf constructs a content stream by string 
  concatenation (test_native_pdf_images_model.py:41). The hardcoded fzImg0 name
  relies on PyMuPDF's internal naming convention. If a PyMuPDF version changes
  its naming, the test breaks silently. Consider extracting the actual name from
   the page's resources after insert_image.
  10. No __init__.py verification — CLAUDE.md requires every top-level package
  directory to have __init__.py. model/ should already have one, but worth
  confirming pdf_content_ops.py is importable as model.pdf_content_ops.
  11. discover_native_image_invocations is called multiple times per operation —
   once in get_object_info_at_point, then again in _find_native_image_invocation
   during the subsequent move/rotate/delete. Each call re-parses the content
  stream. Not a correctness issue but a performance concern for pages with many
  images.

  Recommendation: Fix P0-1 (the q count bubbling) before merging — it's the most
   likely to corrupt real-world PDFs. The occurrence_index assumption (P0-2)
  should at least get a defensive check or a comment explaining when it can
  fail. The rest can be addressed incrementally.

✻ Churned for 1m 33s

※ recap: You're implementing native PDF image manipulation in objects mode. I just finished a code review of the unstaged changes — all 7 tests pass but I found two correctness bugs worth fixing before committing: q-scope invocation counting and occurrence index alignment. (disable recaps in /config)

❯ /review Implemented the two P0 fixes from the native-image review.            
                                                                                
In [pdf_content_ops.py](/<HOME>/Documents/python%20programs/pdf_editor/ 
model/pdf_content_ops.py), `Do` counts now bubble to every open `q` scope, so   
deleting one image can no longer misclassify an outer `q..Q` block as           
“single-image safe” when it still contains a nested sibling. The same module    
also no longer ties native-image discovery to `page.get_image_info()` ordering  
or availability: it keeps UI identity in content-stream order, derives          
bbox/rotation from the parsed `cm` transform when present, and only uses        
per-xref placement APIs as a fallback. That closes both review risks without    
weakening any assertions.                                                       
                                                                                
I also tightened the nested-`q` fixture in                                      
[test_native_pdf_images_model.py](/<HOME>/Documents/python%20programs/p 
df_editor/test_scripts/test_native_pdf_images_model.py) so it truly contains    
only the two intended image invocations, and added a small architecture note in 
 [ARCHITECTURE.md](/<HOME>/Documents/python%20programs/pdf_editor/docs/ 
ARCHITECTURE.md) plus a pitfall note in [PITFALLS.md](/<HOME>/Documents

  Review: P0 Fixes for Native PDF Image Manipulation

  Overview

  Two targeted fixes for the issues raised in the prior review:

  1. P0-1 (q-scope bubbling): _q_bounds_by_operator_index now iterates all
  ancestor q frames on the stack when a Do is encountered (line 209: for q_index
   in stack), so the invocation count reflects the total Do ops enclosed at
  every nesting level. This directly prevents the "delete one image, silently
  remove a sibling in an outer scope" bug.
  2. P0-2 (image_info ordering dependency): Discovery no longer indexes into
  get_image_info() by encounter order. Instead it computes bbox from the parsed
  cm transform via the new _bbox_from_stream_cm helper, falling back to
  page.get_image_rects(xref, transform=True) per-xref placement tracking. This
  eliminates the assumption that get_image_info entries align with
  content-stream encounter order.

  Correctness Assessment

  P0-1 fix — Verified correct. The for q_index in stack loop (line 209)
  correctly increments counts for all open q scopes. The test
  test_delete_native_image_does_not_delete_nested_sibling_in_outer_q constructs
  the exact scenario: outer q containing a nested q..Do..Q plus a sibling Do.
  Deleting the sibling now correctly sees q_image_invocation_count == 2 on the
  outer scope and falls through to the minimal cm + Do removal path instead of
  deleting the entire q..Q block.

  P0-2 fix — Verified correct. The new _bbox_from_stream_cm computes bbox by
  transforming the unit square through the cm matrix and flipping Y. Two new
  tests directly validate the fix:
  - test_native_discovery_does_not_depend_on_get_image_info_order —
  monkeypatches get_image_info to return items reversed; asserts bboxes are
  still correct.
  - test_native_discovery_survives_missing_get_image_info — monkeypatches to
  return []; asserts discovery still works from cm alone.

  Remaining Issues

  P1 — Should address

  1. _make_shared_native_image_pdf still hardcodes fzImg0 (test line 41). If
  PyMuPDF changes its internal naming convention, this fixture silently breaks.
  The image name is discoverable from page.get_images(full=True) — extract it
  dynamically like _make_outer_q_nested_sibling_pdf already does (lines 52-55).
  Low effort, removes a fragile assumption.
  2. _bbox_from_stream_cm Y-flip uses page_rect.height (line 179) which is
  MediaBox height. If a page has a /CropBox that differs from /MediaBox, the
  fitz coordinate system reports positions relative to CropBox but page.rect
  returns CropBox. This is actually fine for fitz — page.rect already accounts
  for CropBox. But the cm values in the stream are in raw PDF coordinates
  (MediaBox-based). Consider using page.mediabox.height instead of
  page.rect.height for the Y-flip to match the content stream coordinate system.

  2. Risk: On pages where CropBox != MediaBox, native images could appear at the
   wrong Y position.
  3. placement_offsets per-xref counter (lines 218-222, 260-264) assumes
  placements from get_image_rects appear in the same order as Do operators in
  the content stream. The PyMuPDF docs don't guarantee this. If you have the
  same image referenced from two different content streams in a different order
  than get_image_rects returns them, the fallback bbox could be misassigned.
  Since this is only the fallback path (primary is cm-derived), the blast radius
   is small.

  P2 — Minor / Informational

  4. serialize_tokens still joins with \n per token (line 305). As noted
  previously, this bloats streams. Not blocking, but worth a follow-up.
  5. Double-parse per operation is unchanged — get_object_info_at_point parses,
  then _find_native_image_invocation parses again for move/rotate/delete.
  Performance-acceptable for now but worth noting for pages with 50+ images.

  Test Reliability Assessment

  The tests are reliable and well-structured:

  - Direct scenario coverage: each P0 bug has a dedicated regression test that
  would fail if the fix regressed.
  - Monkeypatch-based isolation: the get_image_info tests correctly monkeypatch
  at the fitz.Page level, ensuring the test actually exercises the fallback
  path.
  - The nested-q fixture is clean: it builds exactly the structure that triggers
   the bug (outer q with 2 image Do ops, one nested) and verifies the survivor
  remains hit-testable with correct bbox.
  - One gap: no test for the no-cm case (image placed without an explicit cm
  operator). The fallback path via get_image_rects is tested implicitly by the
  "missing get_image_info" test, but a test where cm is genuinely absent from
  the stream would more directly exercise cm_operator_index is None and verify
  the move/resize failure path.

  Verdict

  Both P0 fixes are correct. The new _bbox_from_stream_cm helper and the for 
  q_index in stack bubbling are clean, minimal changes that directly close the
  identified risks. The test coverage for the fixes is strong. The remaining P1
  items (hardcoded fzImg0, MediaBox vs CropBox Y-flip) are real but
  lower-severity and can be addressed incrementally.

✻ Sautéed for 1m 5s

※ recap: Native PDF image manipulation in objects mode is nearly done — both P0 fixes from review are implemented and all tests pass. Next action: fix the hardcoded fzImg0 name in the shared-image test fixture to use the actual name from page resources. (disable recaps in /config)
