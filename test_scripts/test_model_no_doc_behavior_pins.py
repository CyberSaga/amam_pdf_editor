"""Behavior pins for PDFModel with NO open document (PR-7 refactor evidence).

These tests deliberately PIN CURRENT CRASH BEHAVIOR of the model when no
document is open. PR-7 replaces the flagged `self.doc`/`model.doc` accesses
with typed local binds (`doc: fitz.Document = self.doc`) purely to satisfy
mypy; the runtime semantics — including the exact exception raised when the
doc is None — must stay byte-identical.

Coverage note (codex review follow-up): these are THREE REPRESENTATIVE pins
(one per failure shape: TypeError via public export_pages, TypeError via public
edit_text, guarded False via _repair_active_doc_in_memory) — not an exhaustive
pin of all 26 refactored sites. The remaining sites (_restore_doc_from_snapshot,
_roundtrip_live_doc, _full_save_to_path, _render_page_gray_array,
_image_xref_digest, native-image object helpers) are internal, reachable only
behind caller guards, and were verified byte-identical by diff review (codex
adversarial pass, 2026-07-04) rather than pinned here.

They assert on CRASH behavior on purpose. The current no-doc failure modes are
heterogeneous (TypeError here, silent no-op elsewhere), which is exactly why a
unified raising `_require_doc()` guard was REJECTED at design time (it would
change behavior). A future, behavior-allowed PR may unify the no-doc guards and
replace these pins accordingly.
