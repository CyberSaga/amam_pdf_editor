# Fixes Results Report

**Date:** 2026-04-02  
**Baseline Commit:** `683a103d67e213083ad6043ecef9880555603158`  
**Scope:** final cleanup for the review notes in `Verification Results.md` and `issues-04021826.md`

## 1. Summary

This export records the last code-quality cleanup requested for Acrobat-level UX:

- removed the orphaned `self.result` line from the abstract `EditCommand.undo()` body
- corrected `EditTextCommand.execute()` to advertise its real `bool` return value
- kept the base `EditCommand.execute()` contract as `None` for non-text commands
- preserved the existing runtime behavior and regression coverage

## 2. Implemented Changes

### `model/edit_commands.py`

- deleted the stray `self.result: EditTextResult = EditTextResult.SUCCESS` line that was left inside the abstract `undo()` stub
- changed `EditTextCommand.execute()` from `-> None` to `-> bool`
- kept `EditCommand.execute()` as `-> None`, which remains the truthful base contract
- left the existing `EditTextCommand.result` initialization in `__init__` intact

### Regression Tests

Coverage already exists in [test_text_edit_manager_foundation.py](<HOME>/Documents/python%20programs/pdf_editor/test_scripts/test_text_edit_manager_foundation.py):

- verifies `EditTextCommand.result` exists immediately after construction
- verifies the abstract `EditCommand.execute()` contract remains optional for non-text commands
- verifies `EditTextCommand.execute()` is annotated as `bool`

## 3. Verification Results

### Focused contract tests

```powershell
python -m pytest test_scripts\test_text_edit_manager_foundation.py -k "initializes_result_before_execute or execute_contract_stays_optional or execute_annotation_is_bool" -v
```

Result:

```text
3 passed, 7 deselected, 5 warnings in 0.37s
```

### Regression slice

```powershell
python -m pytest test_scripts\test_text_edit_manager_foundation.py test_scripts\test_text_editing_gui_regressions.py -v
```

Result:

```text
39 passed, 7 warnings in 0.59s
```

## 4. Status

| Area | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| orphaned `self.result` in abstract `undo()` | PASS | removed from the base class stub |
| `EditTextCommand.execute()` return annotation | PASS | now accurately `bool` |
| base `EditCommand.execute()` contract | PASS | remains `None` |
| regression coverage | PASS | contract behavior locked in |

## 5. Residual Notes

- The same pre-existing Qt disconnect warnings in `view/pdf_view.py` still appear during some tests.
- They do not fail the suite and were not part of this cleanup request.

## 6. Outcome

The remaining review cleanup is complete and exported. The code now matches the implementation contract more closely without changing the user-facing Acrobat-level UX behavior.
